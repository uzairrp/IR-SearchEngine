# Search Engine with Web Analytics
# IR Project

This projects contains the code for treating raw, real-world data and preparing it for a search engine. It also contains the startup Flask files for developing a web application.

The Notebook is structured into three main parts, each dedicated to a distinct stage of processing textual data for indexing and ranking. It is designed to analyze textual files, create searchable indices, and rank results based on relevance.

## Analysis
This section focuses on processing raw text data. It involves:

    * Reading text files from a specified directory.

    * Cleaning and tokenizing the text.

    * Extracting metadata (such as titles or headings).

    * Performing Named Entity Recognition (NER)/keyword extraction.

## Indexing
In this stage:

    * The cleaned and processed text is converted into a suitable index structure.

    * TF-IDF or other vector-based models may be used.

    * An inverted index or a document-term matrix is created for fast search and retrieval.

## Ranking
This final section:

    * Accepts a search query or keyword input.

    * Calculates similarity scores between the query and the indexed documents.

    * Sorts and ranks the documents based on relevance.

    * Outputs the top-ranked documents with scores or matched highlights.

To run the code, it is necessary to Ensure your input text files are located in the directory defined early in the notebook. Also, the notebook may generate or expect output files such as:

    *Cleaned text or token files.

    * Index files (.pkl, .json, or similar).

    * Ranking results (printed or saved to a file).

It is a good idea to ensure that the paths (to the output directories) exist or are created. In case of any issues with the dependencies, it is recommended to install the packages using pip commands.
Finally, it is to be noted that:

    * This notebook is modular, each part can be run independently if data dependencies are met.
    
    * Itâ€™s a good idea to run all cells in order at least once to initialize variables and paths properly.


## Starting the Web App

```bash
python -V
# Make sure we use Python 3

cd search-engine-web-app
python web_app.py
```
The above will start a web server with the application:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'web-app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8088/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Open Web app in your Browser:  
[http://127.0.0.1:8088/](http://127.0.0.1:8088/) or [http://localhost:8088/](http://localhost:8088/)


## Virtualenv for the project (first time use)
### Install virtualenv
Having different version of libraries for different projects.  
Solves the elevated privilege issue as virtualenv allows you to install with user permission.

In the project root directory execute:
```bash
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv --version
```
virtualenv 20.10.0

### Prepare virtualenv for the project
In the root of the project folder run:
```bash
virtualenv .
```

If you list the contents of the project root directory, you will see that it has created several sub-directories, including a bin folder (Scripts on Windows) that contains copies of both Python and pip. Also, a lib folder will be created by this action.

The next step is to activate your new virtualenv for the project:

```bash
source bin/activate
```

or for Windows...
```cmd
myvenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

This will load the python virtualenv for the project.

### Installing Flask and other packages in your virtualenv
```bash
pip install Flask pandas nltk faker
```

Enjoy!




## Git Help
After creating the project and code in local computer...

1. Login to GitHub and create a new repo.
2. Go to the root page of your new repo and note the url from the browser.
3. Execute the following locally.
4. 
```bash
cd <project root folder>
git init -b main
git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin <your GitHub repo URL from the browser>
git push -u origin main
```
